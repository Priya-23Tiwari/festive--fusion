            <p>Eid-ul-Fitr is a special occasion for Muslim and is a time for celebration with family and loved ones. Eid ul Fitr marks the end of the month of Ramadan, a period of month-long fasting for Muslims around the world, and the start of Shawwal, the tenth month in the Islamic (Hijri) calendar.
            There are two days out of the year dedicated to a celebration called Eid, in the Islamic (Hijri) calendar. Eid ul-Fitr occurs at the end of the month of Ramadan each year, and Eid al-Adha, which occurs on the 10th, 11th and 12 of Dhul Hijjah, last month of the Islamic year.</p>

            <p>The word Eid translates as “the festival of breaking the fast”, marking the end of Ramadan, in which Muslims fast from dawn until dusk. 
               It's a day of joy and celebration in having spent Ramadan in Allah's pleasure, and for fulfilling our duty to Allah to abstain from food and drink during daylight hours. The day is usually characterised by praying Eid prayers, spending time with loved ones, and enjoying good food. 
               Eid ul-Fitr is a time to appreciate and enjoy the blessings Allah has given us, as well as remembering those less fortunate who may not have the means to celebrate the holy occasion. It's also a great time for increased worship and devotion to Allah, as we show happiness and gratitude to Him.</p>

            <p><b>Share gifts and glad tidings:</b> Share in the celebration of a day ordained by Allah!</p>

            <p>In Islam, Eid al-Fitr symbolises that by being patient and steadfast, we can earn great rewards. Celebrated as a reward for completing a  month of fasting from dawn to dusk, Eid ul-Fitr can be seen to represent the bliss of the hereafter life if one is dutiful and pleases Allah in this life.  
               Eid ul-Fitr also symbolises the importance of remembering Allah in all occasions. The most important ritual of Eid, is the Eid Salah- a prayer in congregation with their fellow Muslim community to thank Allah (SWT) and enjoin in good. 
            Eid ul-Fitr symbolises what Allah has promised us in the Holy Qur'an: 
            Surely with hardship comes ease.</p>
            <p>After a month of fasting from dawn to dusk, physically, Ramadan can be quite tough for many Muslims. Eid ul-Fitr is a reward for this, and a day of celebration with family and friends.
