            <p>Christians mark Christmas Day by attending special church services, spending time with family members, wearing new clothes and eating a festive meal. Some families exchange gifts or give small presents or sweets to children. They may display small electric lamps or small clay oil-burning lamps and decorate their homes with banana or mango leaves. Some also put up a nativity scene with clay figures or a Christmas tree. Christmas trees in India are usually imitation pine trees or branches of native trees or bushes.
               Some stores and malls may put up Christmas decorations and have actors playing Santa. Christmas celebrations in tourist areas and hotels may be created to emulate how Christmas Day is celebrated in the countries where tourists and travelers are from.</p>

            <p>Why is 25 December Christmas day on each year? Most people think it is celebrated as the birth date of Jesus Christ, but no one knows the real birth date of Jesus. The Bible has no date regarding the birth of Jesus. The early Christians had many arguments regarding the birth of Jesus. 
                The first recorded date of celebrating Christmas in the Roman Church was on 25 December in 336 AD, during the time of Roman Emperor Constantine. He was the first Christian Roman Emperor who had adopted Christianity as the effective religion of the empire. This was when Christmas started, and people started following the new religion. 
                Later in 529 AD, Pope Julius I declared Happy Christmas Day a civic holiday and announced the date of December 25th to be the date to celebrate Jesus Christâ€™s birth. However, there are many different traditions and arguments towards the background of 25 December Christmas Day.

            <p>Who is Santa Claus? Why is he Famous?
            Wait!! How did we get our Santa Claus? The origin of Santa Claus is based on the life of Saint Nicholas, a real-life, historical follower of Jesus Christ. St. Nicholas was born in Turkey around 280 AD and became a saint after giving away all his wealth to aid the poor and the needy. He is popularly known as the patron saint of children and is remembered on December 6th. On Christmas eve, Santa Claus distributes gifts to the kids. People eat cakes, feast, and express joy and happiness.</p>
            <p>The diverse traditions and beliefs woven into the history of Christmas, revel in the joy of this day. It's a time of celebration, particularly for kids who eagerly anticipate gifts from family and the beloved Santa Claus, a central figure in Christmas festivities. Make the day even more special by celebrating with your family and engaging your children in delightful Christmas arts and crafts activities. It's a wonderful way to add an extra touch of excitement and creativity to their holiday experience.
